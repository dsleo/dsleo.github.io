How do mathematician come up with names? And what is this animation anyway?

How do anyone name "new things"? It's part of the discovery process to associate a name to the discovery. The marketing of Science in a way.

# My first crush in mathematics was imaginary numbers.
I clearly remember being told as a young high schooler about how when I'll grow up I will learn about those mysterious numbers. 

I just learn that squares were positives, until they weren't anymore. But I couldn't simply wait to be in the right class, so I went to my high school library and check out the Terminale's textbook[^1] (Terminal is the last year of highschool in France). 

Some people fall in love with mathematics out of a thirst for knowledge, or a desire to understand patterns. I was attracted by names. Imaginary numbers sounded forbidden, slightly illicit—mathematics smuggling fiction into rigor.

# My second crush came much later and it was **étale cohomology**.
Slightly before starting my PhD, I learnt about derived and triangulated categories and went straight to the source, [S.G.A 4½](https://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/sga/SGA%204%20%26%20HALF%20-%20Cohomologie%20Etale.pdf). 

Contrary to the other episodes of the [Séminaire de Géometrie Algébrique du Bois-Marie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9minaire_de_G%C3%A9om%C3%A9trie_Alg%C3%A9brique_du_Bois_Marie), this one was not a seminar. It is a compilation of Pierre Deligne's notes on some notions and results that sits in between SGA 4 and SGA 5.

The name *étale* also used literally in english struck me. What object could be *étale*, and why not the less poetic and more practical *étalé*?

It evokes smoothness, lightness, something that spreads without tearing. It feels more like a landscape than a construction. According to J. S. Milne:

>“Grothendieck chose the word étale because the way he pictured étale morphisms reminded him of a calm sea at high tide under a full moon.”

# So what is this graph  ?

It is a visualization of all the artefacts in SGA 4½—lemmas, propositions, theorems—and their logical dependencies. Each node is a statement; each edge records “this is used to prove that.” What emerges is not a linear text, but a dense mathematical ecosystem.

Did I tell you that "Mal nommer les choses..."[^2] ?
